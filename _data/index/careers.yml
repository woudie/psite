    detail: I began my under graduate studies back in fall of 2017. Initially, I began as a computer engineer, 
            but upon discovering that I had a passion for things not just electronic and software, but also mechnical,
            I promptly transferred to engineering systems and computing. Since my transfer, I taken a wide array courses
            ranging from digital electronic design to fluid mechanics. In addition to maintaining good academic standings,
            I am heavily involved with the universities robotics team and interdisplinary space project, where I try to apply
            my classroom taught knowledge to real life applications such as robots and rockets.

    detail: I began working as a highschool co-op student back in july 2015 as part of my highschools co-op program. After I completed my co-op term, I was offered
            a more long term part time position at the firm due to my performance during the co-op term. During my time off from school, I work full-time at the firm
            completing a variety of duties ranging from designing and constructing custom aeronautics to manufacturing precision aerospace-grade components. During
            the school year, I try to assist the company on software-related projects. Lately, most of my work has been related to software and electronics due to a
            project I am heavily involved in.

    detail: A fellow school mate and I were hand selected to become the developers for the new website for the new SHSM program that was created at my school known as
            Enviromental SHSM. I was responsible for the intial design of the website and the development of the front end of the website, while my school mate handled
            all backend related development. In addition to the development of the front end, I helped my school mate resolve issues with the front end, and regularly
            maintained the website during the time that I was involved with the project. Additionally, I developed some supporting documents so that future students knew
            how to maintain the website for years to come
