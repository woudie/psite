    detail: I began my under graduate studies back in fall of 2017. Initially, I began as a computer engineer, 
            but upon discovering that I had a passion for things not just electronic and software, but also mechnical,
            I promptly transferred to engineering systems and computing. Since my transfer, I taken a wide array courses
            ranging from digital electronic design to fluid mechanics. In addition to maintaining good academic standings,
            I am heavily involved with the universities robotics team and interdisplinary space project, where I try to apply
            my classroom taught knowledge to real life applications such as robots and rockets.
