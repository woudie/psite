The new website is nearing completion. I tend to re-iterate my website from time to time because I get bored with the previous design. It has been a while since I got my website back up and running since my web hosting subscription ended nearly a year and a half ago. I have my first co-op work term coming up this summer and I thought it would be a good idea to get it back up and running again! I will be posting from time to time about random thoughts, cool things I find online
